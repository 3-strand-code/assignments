# What is deployment?


## For a static website (just html, css, js clientside)

So, you've probably built a site with HTML/CSS and maybe a little JavaScript, but how do people get to 
these pages? 

We can to "deploy" them to some web hosting provider like [Heroku](link to heroku assignment), or 
[GitHub Pages](link to github assignment).


## For a dynamic website (php, python, node, etc.)

A dynamic website typically has:
 
1) a database attached to it
2) some way to serve static files (amazon s3 storage, github pages)
3) some way to handle requests (nginx, apache)
4) some way to generate html (php, django, flask, node, etc.)

A service like Heroku helps automate away a lot of the pain that goes with manually configuring these pieces.

With Heroku you create a Git repo, create a heroku app in the repo, make your website using the correct 
file/folder structure, and boom Heroku will infer a typical setup for your code repo. For example, if you were
to create an index.html in your root folder, Heroku will assume you are serving a simple static website.

If you were to upload a typical Python Django web project structure, Heroku would setup the necessary dependencies
on the server and connect many things up for you... as long as you point it to your Python module correctly!
