# Draw something with a turtle

<sub>*Note: before playing with turtles make sure you have done the basic Python tutorials from [the first](00. The basics.md) assignment*</sub>

For this exercise, we're going to use a module in the [Python 3 standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) called
Turtle. You can see the full docs for Turtle [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

Let's fire up our Python REPL (type `python` into your shell)

    $ python
    Python 3.5.0 (default, Sep 23 2015, 04:41:38) 
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 


Import everything we'll need, then call `home()` to display the turtle screen 

    >>> from turtle import home, left, right, forward, penup, pendown
    >>> home()

Use the `Turtle` methods: `left`, `right`, and `forward` to start moving the turtle around!

    >>> forward(15)  # this moves us forward 15 pixels
    >>> left(50)  # rotate our nose to the left 50 degrees
    >>> right(100)  # same as above but to the right 100 degrees


Now that we have a `Turtle` object and we can move it around, let's make it start tracing its path

    >>> pendown()
    >>> forward(20)
    >>> penup()

Coool!

Let's do a loop for some reason

    >>> for _ in range(20):
    ....:     forward(20)
    ....:     penup()
    ....:     forward(20)
    ....:     pendown()
    ....:


Now draw something of your own, here's how you clear the screen

    >>> reset()
