# The basics


## Python syntax/loops/objects/etc.

1. Do all of [these](http://learnpython.org/) tutorials 
2. ?
3. Profit

## Install python locally

Install python **3.5.0** lots of tutorials online, google for a tutorial for your machine if it's not listed.

### Mac 

From the shell
    
    $ brew install python3
    
### Windows

https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1-amd64.exe

Then you'll need to add the Python executable to your path, google around to figure out how to do this!

## Test it

Once it's installed try `python` in your shell, you should see something like this:

```
    $ python
    Python 3.5.0 (default, Sep 23 2015, 04:41:38) 
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 
```

If you can't figure any of this out ask for some help in Slack and then improve these docs to help
 others!
