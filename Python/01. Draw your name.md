# Draw your name

For this exercise, we're going to use a module in the [Python 3 standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) called
Turtle. You can see the full docs for Turtle [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

Let's fire up our Python REPL

    $ python

Creating an instance of the `Turtle` class which will display our game screen and turtle when we initialize it

    >>> from turtle import Turtle
    >>> t = Turtle()

Use the `Turtle` methods: `left`, `right`, and `forward` to start moving the turtle around!

    >>> t.forward(15)  # this moves us forward 15 pixels
    >>> t.left(50)  # rotate our nose to the left 50 pickles
    >>> t.right(100)  # same as above but to the right 100 pickles


Now that we have a `Turtle` object and we can move it around, let's make it start tracing its path

    >>> t.pendown()
    >>> t.forward(20)
    >>> t.penup()

Coool!

Let's do a loop for some reason

    >>> for _ in range(20):
    ....:     forward(20)
    ....:     penup()
    ....:     forward(20)
    ....:     pendown()
    ....:


Now let's draw my name, Eric:
