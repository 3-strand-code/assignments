# Sexy Shopping List

**TODO: This is a work in progress -- some pain in writing this, so many possible pre-reqs! 
(command line, PATH, etc. on top of database storage)**

In this assignment we'll make a neat little shopping list tracker for everyone in your household. We're going
to do everything as simple as possible. Designing an app this way typically isn't going to make
something that will last a long time -- but, it's going to teach us some solid principles and help us
understand why there's better ways of doing things.

We'll have a list of food items that we'll manually add to our database. After we add them, we'll track
whether we have the food in stock (ready to cook) or if we're out (need to buy).

If you want to get fancy, you can use the list of food we have to generate possible recipes!

## Pre-reqs

1. Console
2. Heroku
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap


## Make our interface

Basically we want:

1. A navbar
2. Buttons to switch between "Food to buy", "Food to cook" and optionally "Recipes"
3. In each view some list of categories and items in that category

## Setup storage

1. Do the Firebase [tutorial](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/), it's very quick.
2. Sign up and go to your dashboard
3. Make an app for our storage:
