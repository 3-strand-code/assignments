# Sexy Shopping List

**TODO: This is a work in progress -- some pain in writing this, so many possible pre-reqs! 
(command line, PATH, etc. on top of database storage)**

In this assignment we'll make a neat little shopping list tracker for everyone in your household. We're going
to do everything as simple as possible. Designing an app this way typically isn't going to make
something that will last a long time -- but, it's going to teach us some solid principles and help us
understand why there's better ways of doing things.

We'll have a list of food items that we'll manually add to our database. After we add them, we'll track
whether we have the food in stock (ready to cook) or if we're out (need to buy).

If you want to get fancy, you can use the list of food we have to generate possible recipes!

## Pre-reqs

1. Console
2. Heroku
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap (layout design)
5. jQuery (interactivity)

Also, add these stories to your pivotal:

1. Design simple frontend (3 sub tasks for navbar, buttons and the list of item categories + items) 
2. Sign up on Firebase and create app
3. User should be able to move a food from "to buy" list, to "to cook" list -- i.e. you just bought it at the store
4. User should be able to move food from "to cook" list, to "to buy" list -- i.e. you just cooked it
4. User should get some kind of undo warning when doing any transitions, clicking undo reverts the transition. Useful if you fat finger moving the wrong item to the wrong section.


## Front end

Basically we want:

1. A navbar
2. Buttons to switch between "Food to buy", "Food to cook" and optionally "Recipes"
3. In each view some list of categories and items in that category

## Setup storage

1. Do the Firebase [tutorial](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/), it's very quick.
2. Sign up and go to your dashboard
3. Make an app for our storage:

## Add our lists

When creating references to our Firebase app, we can add endpoints willy nilly like so:
```javascript
var foodsToBuy = new Firebase("https://sexyshoppinglist.firebaseio.com/toBuy")
```

The above command doesn't send/create/do anything, until we do some action with it:
```javascript
foodsToBuy.push("apples")
```

Now we have `["apples"]` stored in our `toBuy` list!

Let's do the same for foods we want to cook:
```javascript
var foodsToCook = new Firebase("https://sexyshoppinglist.firebaseio.com/toCook")
foodsToCook.push("tacquitos")
```

(for more information, see the [Firebase - Understanding Data](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/understanding-data.html) docs)


# Remove from our lists

Removing with Firebase is much more cumbersome than simply pushing, we'll need to overwrite
the whole array with a new one (minus the item we want to remove).

This is dangerous, especially if we have multiple clients working with the same resource. That's
a big downside to our simple implementation. Future/better implementations of this
app will use better methods that handle simultaneous transactions better.

# Heroku

Once you've tested everything locally and it seems to be working, we'll deploy it to a
Heroku instance and actually use it!
